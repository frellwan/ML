## Applications of Machine Learning
This course teaches how to use machine learning techniques to solve a wide variety of problems. This course will give you a strong grasp of the general principles of machine learning, including familiarity with
common approaches, assumptions, and methodologies. You should be able to assess the strengths, weaknesses,
and use cases of ML algorithms, and to select and apply the right tools for custom classification, regression, and
analysis problems. 

### Week 1
Demonstrate the vectorized math of numpy

### Week 2
Write a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch for the UC IRvine Diabetes dataset and compare to the sklearn implementation. Use SVMlight to see if a support vector machine performs better than a Naive Bayes classifier.

### Week 3
Compare multiple models (Naive Bayes Classifier with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions and a Decision Forest) for the MNIST dataset. Thios compares pereprocessing the images vs no preprocessing as well.

### Week 4
Using the UC Irvine banknote dataset, train a support vector machine using stochastic gradient decent.
