## Coding 2 - Lasso Regression
This repository demonstrates the implementation of Lasso regression using the Coordinate Descent algorithm on the Boston housing dataset. 
It includes data preparation, transformation, and a custom function (MyLasso) to compute Lasso coefficients. The results are validated by 
comparing the custom implementation with the glmnet package, ensuring accuracy. Key steps involve loading data, transforming variables, 
and iteratively updating coefficients. The provided R code highlights efficient computation and comparison techniques for Lasso regression.
