# Statistacal Learning
This course provides an introduction to modern techniques for statistical analysis of complex and massive data. Examples of these are model selection for regression/classification, nonparametric models including splines and kernel models, regularization, model ensemble, recommender system, and clustering analysis. Learn applications as well as computation and theoretical foundations.

## Coding 2 - Lasso Regression
This coding demonstrates the implementation of Lasso regression using the Coordinate Descent algorithm on the Boston housing dataset. It includes data preparation, transformation, and a custom function (MyLasso) to compute Lasso coefficients. The results are validated by comparing the custom implementation with the glmnet package, ensuring accuracy. Key steps involve loading data, transforming variables, and iteratively updating coefficients. The provided R code highlights efficient computation and comparison techniques for Lasso regression.
